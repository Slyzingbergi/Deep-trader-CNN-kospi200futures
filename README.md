# Kospi200 index futures Prediction using CNN
This model is a simple and plain work to predict kospi200 index futures prices based on convolutional neural networks.
The python scripts forecast tommorrow's kospi200 index futures CLOSE directions. 8 consecutive days' futures prices and other values until today are used as features. 
The purpose of this job is to see if CNN also work properly with financial markets data, not to see its performances.
Many of the codes related to CNN multi layers were picked from  ‘First Contack with TensorFlow‘ written by Jordi Torres.
